## About the Project
### Introduction
This repository contains the Python 3's Jupyter Notebook created during **RIOT Robotics' Python 3 Bootcamp / Workshop**. The contents of this notebook range from the very basics to the somwhat moderate or obscure topics of Python 3; as such, it is divided into two (2) parts, namely: **a learning segment** and **a excercises segment**. 

It is noteworthy to state that there are two (2) ways to see the contents of the **.ipynb**, one of which requires a series of dependencies to be installed to a computer and another which requires **ONLY** internet connection. See **Usage** section!

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This notebook was created in Micrsoft's Visual Studio Code with its **Jupyter Extensions**; these being: **Jupyter**, **Jupyter Cell Tags**, **Jupyter Keymap** and **Jupyter Slideshow**. In addition, Python 3 was used and it can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/). There version which was used was **Python 3.10.5**.

### Installation
Start Visual Studio Code and install the aformentioned extensions. In addition, it is recomended to create a Python 3 Virtual Enviroment by typing in Visual Studio's Terminal the following:
```console
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
```
After the creation of the virtual enviroment, the following preqrequisites can be installed:
-  ï»¿asttokens==2.2.1
-  backcall==0.2.0
-  colorama==0.4.6
-  comm==0.1.3
-  debugpy==1.6.7
-  decorator==5.1.1
-  executing==1.2.0
-  ipykernel==6.23.2
-  ipython==8.14.0
-  jedi==0.18.2
-  jupyter_client==8.2.0
-  jupyter_core==5.3.1
-  matplotlib-inline==0.1.6
-  nest-asyncio==1.5.6
-  numpy==1.25.0
-  packaging==23.1
-  parso==0.8.3
-  pickleshare==0.7.5
-  platformdirs==3.7.0
-  prompt-toolkit==3.0.38
-  psutil==5.9.5
-  pure-eval==0.2.2
-  Pygments==2.15.1
-  python-dateutil==2.8.2
-  pywin32==306
-  pyzmq==25.1.0
-  six==1.16.0
-  stack-data==0.6.2
-  tornado==6.3.2
-  traitlets==5.9.0
-  wcwidth==0.2.6

All of this can be installed with:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It should be noted that the notebook was ran in Windows.

## Usage
There are various ways to use to use this software. Two of which are as follows:
1. **Option 1:** Run the notebook via Visual Studio Code.
2. **Option 2:** Copy this URL link from the repostory, i.e.: [https://github.com/Sergeant-Potato/Python-3_Bootcamp/blob/main/src/Python%20Bootcamp.ipynb](https://github.com/Sergeant-Potato/Python-3_Bootcamp/blob/main/src/Python%20Bootcamp.ipynb), go to [**NBVIEWER.ORG**](https://nbviewer.org/), and paste the link on the page's search bar.

Now matter the method the used, this should be the output, as shown via _NBVIEWER.ORG_:
